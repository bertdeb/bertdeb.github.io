As an active contributor to [OpenHistoricalMap](http://openhistoricalmap.org), I've seen things that need fixing, so I've taken on 
some responsibility for fixing them. Several of us like-minded folks met recently to discuss a way forward, and we all agreed that 
we need to communicate better with the rest of the OpenHistoricalMap (OHM) community.

Since OHM source code is hosted on GitHub, I suggested that we use github.io for a developer blog. While I knew that GitHub pages supported Jekyll, I didn't know just how easy this would be. Now I do :-)
