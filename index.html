	<h1>Hi there, I'm Bert de Bruijn!</h1>
	<p>I'm an IT consultant and founder of <a href="https://wikiwar.net">the WikiWar project</a>. 
		<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
	<p>I'm also involved in a number of smaller projects which ultimately contribute to WikiWar in some way. 
		This blog serves to document the messes I make along the way. Hence the <span data-title=": a fall or dive headfirst">
		Header</span> File.</p>
